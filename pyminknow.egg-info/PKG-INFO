Description: # minKNOW mock server
        
        This code will emulate a [Oxford Nanopore Technologies](https://nanoporetech.com/) gene sequencing device (e.g. [minION](https://nanoporetech.com/products/minion) or minKNOW) using its gRPC Remote Procedure Calls [LIMS interface](https://github.com/nanoporetech/minknow_lims_interface) to interact with its embedded software. This package is designed to form part of a software development environment to facilitate rapid prototyping and automated testing.
        
        # Installation
        
        ## Generating RPC code
        
        The script `compile_grpc.sh` contains the command to compile the protocol buffers and gRPC interface from the `.proto` files in the minKNOW submodule. (See this tutorial on generating Python code: gRPC Basics - Python [Generating client and server code](https://grpc.io/docs/tutorials/basic/python/#generating-client-and-server-code).)
        
        The service expects the Python modules for the gRPC interface to be in `pyminknow/minknow/rpc`.
        
        # Usage
        
        The service may run in a container or in a Python environment. To see the usage reference, run:
        
        ```bash
        $ python pyminknow --help
        ```
        
        
        
        ## Test client
        
        You may use `client.py` to test the functionality of the server. To get help, run:
        
        ```bash
        $ python client.py --help
        ```
        
        
        
        ## Container
        
        The container is based on Debian Linux and uses Python 3.7 as defined in the `Dockerfile`. You may build and run the container using the commands below.
        
        ```bash
        $ docker build --tag pyminknow:latest .
        $ docker run --name minit --publish 5901:5901 -publish 22:22 -d pyminknow:latest
        # Start the SSH service
        $ docker exec -it --user root minit service ssh start
        ```
        
        ## Python
        
        You should do this inside a Python 3.7 virtual environment. Compile the gRPC modules, install packages and then run the service. 
        
        ```bash
        $ sh compile_grpc.sh
        $ pip install -r requirements.txt
        $ python pyminknow
        ```
